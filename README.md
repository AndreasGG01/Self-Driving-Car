# Self-Driving-Car
This repository uses behavioral cloning to train an AI model to drive sufficiently around the track within Udacity's enviornment. The dataset was generated by me, however, other models that exist within the repository from other people and the code used was primarily sourced from https://github.com/naokishibuya/car-behavioral-cloning & https://github.com/seraj94ai/A-self-driving-car-using-behavioral-cloning/tree/master
